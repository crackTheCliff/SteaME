<strong>Description:</strong>
<p>SteaMe is a data visualization project of active players on games in the Steam platform. In this project we utilized React as the Front end along with Express JS for the Back end. We made the color of the gradient and the size of the boxes represent the amount of players actively playing that game. The darker and bigger the box the more players that are currently playing that game.</p>

<strong>Functionality:</strong>
<p>When hovering over any of the boxes you will see a pop-up menu displaying the name of the game and the amount of active players. If you click on the box you are currently hovering over you will it will populate a new display with the rank of the game in the list, the amount of active players, the peak active players in the past 24 hours and three random twitch streams of that current game. Clicking on one of the streams will bring you to that corrosponding twitch channel so you can see live gameplay.
